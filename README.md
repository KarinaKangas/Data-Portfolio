# Data-Portfolio

# Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! My portfolio is a peek into how I juggle stats, code, and visuals to make data tell a story. It all stems from my solid foundation in chemistry and a knack for cracking data puzzles. Whether it's forecasting sales or improving manufacturing processes, every project here is a slice of my analytical journey. Feel free to explore, and see how I turn data hurdles into business insights, one project at a time!
